Current time worked on project 3 hours 34 minutes

To Run the Project

Open the project in your programming tool of choice i.e. Visual Studio

Open the terminal and run npm install and composer install to install all of the dependencies 

Once this is complete run the command “npm run dev” and “php artisan serve” which should start your development environment and start running the bootstrap

Note that I didnt get time to test responsiveness as I was trying to concentrate more on the look of the site for this demo
